# MolElec-RS

This programme is my (now) 3rd attempt at a quantum chemical software. You may think: why would you start three different projects 
and why abandon the previous? 

Simple answer: I got better and know a lot more about programming and software design than before. 
The first programme I wrote was mainly for educational purpose, to prove to myself that I was able to write a programme 
that could basically produce the common quantum chemical results. 
My second programme was written during a lab course at the LMU for a pratical course that was part of my 
Master's course. 

This time I want to write a programme which is fully written by myself in the best possible (to my knowledge) Rust
using the experiences I have gather from the previous experiences.
